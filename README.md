# curtain-menu-js
Sample of a curtain menu using JavaScript for animation.
The curtain menu starts out of the viewport. When it's opening, it slides from the right to the left.
In the css file, the following is coded: #sidenav-container { transform: translateX(100%); }. When the curtaing menu appears, translateX should be 0.
The animation happens in the javascript file, inside the functions openSidenav and closeSidenav. 
Click events are added to the menu open/close icons for the animations to take effect.
